Branches must follow the Gitflow naming convention:

- Feature branches: feature/<short-description>
- Bugfix branches: bugfix/<short-description>
- Release branches: release/<version>
- Hotfix branches: hotfix/<short-description>
- Develop branch: develop
- Main branch: master

Rules:
- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens in <short-description> or <version>.
- No spaces or special characters.
- Branch names must be descriptive and concise.
- Example feature branch: feature/add-login-form
- Example bugfix branch: bugfix/fix-login-error
- Example release branch: release/1.2.0
- Example hotfix branch: hotfix/critical-security-patch

Before creating a branch, ensure you are branching from the correct base:
- Features and bugfixes branch from develop.
- Releases branch from develop.
- Hotfixes branch from master.
