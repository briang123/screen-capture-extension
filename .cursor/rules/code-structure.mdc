# Code Structure and Organization Rule

- When adding or editing code, always place new logic, hooks, or configuration blocks where they make the most logical sense within the file or module.
- Maintain a clear and consistent order: setup and configuration (e.g., beforeEach, afterEach) should be grouped together and ordered logically (setup before teardown).
- Keep related code (e.g., hooks, fixtures, utility functions) together to improve readability and maintainability.
- When reviewing or writing code, feel free to suggest or ask about alternative structures, organization, or sorting to further improve clarity and maintainability.
- If unsure about placement, ask the team or propose options for discussion.
