# Date Awareness Rule

## Overview
Always ensure you know the current date before documenting any date information in documentation, logs, or commit messages.

## Requirements

### Before Documenting Dates
1. **Check Current Date**: Always verify the current date before adding any date information to documentation
2. **Ask for Clarification**: If you're unsure about the current date, ask the user to clarify before proceeding
3. **Use Accurate Dates**: When documenting events, changes, or troubleshooting sessions, use the actual current date

### Documentation Standards
- Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for all dates in documentation
- Include dates in troubleshooting logs, changelogs, and commit messages
- Be consistent with date formatting across all documentation

### Examples
- ✅ "Fixed production mode test failures on 2024-12-19"
- ✅ "Updated troubleshooting documentation on 2024-12-19"
- ❌ "Fixed issues yesterday" (vague, no specific date)
- ❌ "Updated docs recently" (no date provided)

### When to Ask for Date
- If you're unsure about the current date
- If you need to reference a specific date for documentation
- If you're creating time-sensitive documentation

## Implementation
- Always check the current date before adding date information
- Ask the user: "What is the current date?" if you're uncertain
- Use the confirmed date in all documentation and logs
- Maintain consistency in date formatting across the codebase
