# Test Title Length Best Practice

- All test titles should be concise and descriptive, with a recommended maximum length of **100 characters**.
- This ensures test titles are readable in editors, CI logs, and test reports, and avoids line wrapping or formatting issues.
- If additional detail is needed, use comments inside the test body rather than extending the title.
- This rule applies to all test frameworks (e.g., Playwright, Jest, Mocha) used in this project.
