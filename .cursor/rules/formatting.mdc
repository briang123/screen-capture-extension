All files must be automatically formatted and lint errors fixed on save.

Rules:
- Enable "Format on Save" in your editor settings for this project.
- Automatically run the project's linter with the `--fix` option on file save.
- Formatting and linting should use the configuration defined in the project (e.g., `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`).
- Do not commit code with unresolved lint errors or formatting issues.
- If your editor supports it, enable auto-fix for lint errors on save.

Recommended settings:
- VS Code: Set `"editor.formatOnSave": true` and `"editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll": true }` in your workspace settings.
- Use the provided npm scripts (e.g., `npm run lint -- --fix` and `npm run format`) before committing if your editor does not support auto-fix.
