Do not commit secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information to the repository.

Rules:
- Never include secrets, passwords, API keys, tokens, or private credentials in any source code, configuration files, or documentation.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools to handle sensitive information.
- Add common secret patterns and files (e.g., `.env`, `secrets.json`) to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
- Review all code and configuration changes for accidental inclusion of secrets before committing.
- Use automated tools (such as `git-secrets`, `truffleHog`, or GitHub secret scanning) to detect and block secrets in commits and pull requests.
- If a secret is accidentally committed, revoke and rotate it immediately, and remove it from the repository history.

Examples of sensitive information to avoid committing:
- API keys (e.g., `AIza...`, `sk_live_...`)
- Database connection strings
- Private keys or certificates
- Passwords or passphrases
