# Documentation Rule

When making changes to the project, follow these documentation guidelines:

1. **Code Generation Impact**
   - If your changes impact the target projects that use this boilerplate (i.e., projects generated from this template), ensure that the `ai-project-prompt` code generator includes clear and concise verbiage reflecting the updates.
   - The instructions and prompts in the code generator should be easy to understand and help users leverage the new or changed functionality.

2. **Updating prompt.md**
   - Whenever updates are made to the project, update [prompt.md](mdc:prompt.md) with information that would help instruct an AI agent to create this project and its functionality from scratch.
   - Add or revise content in `prompt.md` to help users better understand how to create effective prompts for dynamically generating projects based on this boilerplate.

3. **General Documentation**
   - Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and up to date with the latest project changes.
   - Document new features, configuration options, and usage instructions as needed.

This process ensures that both the code generator and the instructional prompts remain accurate and helpful for users building new projects from this boilerplate.
