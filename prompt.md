# Chrome Extension Boilerplate Generator Prompt

## Overview

This generator scaffolds a Chrome Extension project with a customizable stack. It supports React + Vite and React + Next.js for the website, and includes a CLI and web app for configuration. All features are available in both interfaces.

## Website Framework Options

- **React + Next.js**: Full-featured, SEO-optimized, supports blogs, dashboards, server-side rendering, and more.
- **React + Vite**: Lightweight, fast, best for simple landing pages or single-page apps.

## Why This Choice?

- **React** is always used for the UI.
- **Next.js** and **Vite** are build tools/frameworks for React. Next.js is best for SEO and complex sites; Vite is best for simple, fast SPAs.

## Website Features

- Pricing Information
- Testimonials Section
- Authentication Features
- Cookie Consent Banner (GDPR)
- Newsletter Subscription
- Blog Section
- Search Functionality
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Status Page
- API Documentation
- User Dashboard

## Other Features

- UI type selection (popup, window, sidewindow)
- Tailwind CSS
- i18n
- Options page
- Accessibility
- Authentication (email, Google, GitHub)
- AI integrations (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Google Analytics integration (page views, button clicks, user actions, extension usage)
- Database (Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Pricing model (freemium, subscription, one-time, usage-based)
- Hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, AWS, GitHub Pages)
- Chrome storage type (sync, local, session)

## How It Works

- The CLI and web app share core logic and types.
- The generator produces a detailed AI prompt for project scaffolding.
- Smart defaults are applied based on feature selection.

Create a complete Chrome Extension boilerplate using **React**, **TypeScript** (with strict mode), and **Fastify** with a built-in **Node CLI** for **dynamically customizable scaffolding** and **automated documentation**.

This boilerplate will be published as a **GitHub repository template** for easy reuse in new projects.

---

### üìå Dynamic Scaffolding Requirement

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** No boilerplate or scaffolding should be hardcoded. All project structure, files, and configurations must be dynamically generated based on the user's CLI responses.

- The CLI (`scripts/init.ts`) must prompt the user for all configurable options.
- The CLI should support both interactive (prompt-based) and non-interactive (flags/config file) modes for automation and CI/CD use cases.
- The CLI should validate user input and provide helpful error messages or suggestions.
- The CLI should support a "dry run" mode to preview what will be scaffolded before making changes.
- The CLI should be idempotent (re-running it should not break the project or duplicate files).
- Based on responses, dynamically scaffold only the relevant:
  - Files & folders
  - Environment variables
  - Components, configuration, routes, and assets
  - Documentation under `docs/`
  - `.gitignore` with appropriate exclusions for the selected features
- After collecting user input, generate a comprehensive prompt for AI agents (like Cursor AI, Replit AI, etc.) to create all scaffolding files dynamically based on user choices.
- Save the generated prompt to `docs/ai-project-prompt.md` with clear instructions on how to use it with AI agents.
- The CLI should open the generated file for user review and provide step-by-step guidance on proceeding with AI agent scaffolding.
- Update the manifest, `.env.example`, documentation, and other core files with dynamic values.
- Scaffolded files must include inline `// TODO`, `// CONFIGURE`, or `// REMOVE IF UNUSED` comments.
- Log all scaffolding actions in a file like `docs/scaffold-report.md`.
- The CLI should provide guidance for upgrading the boilerplate in existing projects (e.g., via migration scripts or changelogs).

### üîÑ Incremental Feature Addition

- The CLI must support adding new features or integrations to an existing project at any time, not just during initial setup.
- When re-run, the CLI should:
  - Detect which features are already present.
  - Prompt the user for additional features to add (or remove).
  - Scaffold only the new/changed files, configurations, and documentation as needed.
  - Avoid overwriting user-modified files unless explicitly confirmed.
- The project should maintain a config or metadata file (e.g., `scaffold.json`) to track enabled features and integrations.
