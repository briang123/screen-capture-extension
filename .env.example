# The URL of the site where you want to test or use the extension.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TEST_URL sets the default website that Playwright and the extension will use for automated tests.
# - This should be a valid URL (e.g., https://cleanshot.com).
# - Change this if you want to run tests against a different site.

# Enable or disable screenshot capture during tests (true/false).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COLLECT_SCREENSHOTS controls whether Playwright saves screenshots during test runs.
# - Set to 'true' to save screenshots for debugging or documentation.
# - Set to 'false' to skip screenshot capture and speed up tests.
# - Screenshots are saved in the tests/media directory.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
COLLECT_SCREENSHOTS=true

# Enable or disable full-page screenshot capture during tests (true/false).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COLLECT_FULLPAGE_SCREENSHOTS determines if screenshots should capture the entire page or just the viewport.
# - Set to 'true' to capture the full scrollable page.
# - Set to 'false' to capture only the visible portion of the page.
# - Only applies if COLLECT_SCREENSHOTS is also true.

# Enable or disable video recording during tests (true/false).

# COLLECT_VIDEO controls whether Playwright records a video of each test run.
# - Set to 'true' to save videos for debugging or reviewing test runs.
# - Set to 'false' to skip video recording and speed up tests.
# - Videos are saved in the tests/media directory.

# Enable or disable logging of test results to a file (true/false).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LOG_TEST_RESULTS determines if test results and console logs are saved to a log file.
# - Set to 'true' to save logs for later review or CI analysis.

# === New Playwright UI/Headed/Headless Mode Variables ===

# TEST_MODE controls how Playwright runs your tests:
#   - headless: (default) Runs tests without showing the browser window. Fastest, best for CI/CD.
#   - headed:   Runs tests with the browser window visible. Useful for debugging and development.
#   - ui:       Launches Playwright's interactive UI mode for time-travel debugging and visual test exploration.
# Set this to 'headed' or 'ui' for debugging, or leave unset for headless mode.
TEST_MODE=headless

# SHOW_BROWSER forces the browser window to be shown, even if TEST_MODE is 'headless'.
#   - true:  Always show the browser window, regardless of TEST_MODE.
#   - false: Only show browser if TEST_MODE is 'headed' or 'ui'.
# This is useful if you want to override headless mode for visual debugging.
SHOW_BROWSER=false

# WATCH_MODE enables Playwright's watch mode in UI mode.
#   - true:  Automatically re-runs tests when files change (only applies in UI mode).
#   - false: No auto-rerun on file changes.
# Use this for rapid feedback during test development in UI mode.
WATCH_MODE=false

# TRACE_MODE controls Playwright's trace collection behavior.
#   - on:              Always collect traces for every test (useful for deep debugging).
#   - on-first-retry:  Collect traces only on the first retry of a failed test (default for most setups).
#   - retain-on-failure: Keep traces only for failed tests.
#   - off:             Disable trace collection.
# This can be set to 'on' for maximum debugging info in UI mode, or left unset for default behavior.
TRACE_MODE=on-first-retry
