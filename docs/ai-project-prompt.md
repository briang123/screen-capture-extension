# Chrome Extension Project Specification

## Project Overview

Create a complete Chrome Extension using React, TypeScript (strict mode), and Vite with the following specifications:

## Extension Details

**Extension Name:** screen-capture-extension
**Description:** An extension that will allow user to capture an image of an area of a web page or specific page level elements by snapping to selectors (like when user may be in chrome dev tools and inspecting elements). Once the capture is made, will provide the image capture a beautiful configurable background that can be configured from the extension window. The extension will provide fast and easy way to quickly capture images from the webpage with one-click capture. The user will be able to annotate the image with text, arrows, and shapes that can be moved/dragged around to help the user convey their diagrams better. The extension will allow the user to save the image to clipboard after capturing via the one-click tap of a button. They will also be able to copy to clipboard after annotating and additional be able to save as a file. I would like for the features to be influenced by ScreenShotX and be super useful for the user.

## Selected Features

- Extension Name: screen-capture-extension
- Extension Description: An extension that will allow user to capture an image of an area of a web page or specific page level elements by snapping to selectors (like when user may be in chrome dev tools and inspecting elements).

- Side Window (detached pop-out, ChatGPT-style): Opens in a dedicated side window, not injected into the page.
  - Use a background script to call chrome.windows.create({ url: "window.html", type: "popup", width: 400, height: 800 })
  - The main extension action should only be a launcher, not the full UI.
  - Do NOT inject a UI overlay into the current page.
- Tailwind CSS: Yes
- Options Page: Yes
- Chrome Storage: sync

  # Incremental Feature Updates

## How to Add New Features

### 1. Run the CLI Again

```bash
npm run init
```

### 2. The CLI Will:

- ‚úÖ **Detect existing features** from your current configuration
- üìù **Only prompt for new features** you haven't selected yet
- üîÑ **Preserve your existing code** and configuration
- üìö **Update documentation** with new feature information

### 3. Common Update Scenarios

#### Adding Authentication Later

```bash
npm run init
# Select authentication methods when prompted
# CLI will automatically require a database
```

#### Adding a Website Later

```bash
npm run init
# Select "Include Website" when prompted
# Choose website features (pricing, testimonials, auth)
```

#### Adding AI Features Later

```bash
npm run init
# Select AI providers when prompted
# CLI will suggest adding a database for conversation history
```

#### Adding Pricing Later

```bash
npm run init
# Select pricing model when prompted
# CLI will automatically require a database
```

### 4. What Gets Updated

#### Files That Are Modified:

- `docs/ai-project-prompt.md` - Updated with new features
- `scaffold.json` - Configuration tracking file
- `docs/ai-changelogs.md` - Log of changes made

#### Files That Are Preserved:

- Your existing source code
- Custom modifications you've made
- Environment variables you've configured
- Database schemas you've set up

### 5. Configuration File

The CLI creates a `scaffold.json` file that tracks your configuration:

```json
{
  "extensionName": "My Extension",
  "uiType": "popup",
  "tailwind": true,
  "authMethods": ["google"],
  "database": "firebase",
  "includeWebsite": true,
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 6. Best Practices

#### Before Running Updates:

- ‚úÖ **Commit your changes** to version control
- ‚úÖ **Backup your project** if you're concerned
- ‚úÖ **Test your current setup** to ensure it works

#### After Running Updates:

- ‚úÖ **Review the new AI prompt** for accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Test the new features** in development
- ‚úÖ **Update your documentation** if needed
- ‚úÖ **Deploy changes** when ready

### 7. Troubleshooting Updates

#### If Something Goes Wrong:

1. **Check the changelog:** `docs/ai-changelogs.md` shows what changed
2. **Restore from backup:** Use your version control or backup
3. **Run CLI again:** The CLI is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
4. **Check configuration:** Verify `scaffold.json` has the correct settings

#### Common Issues:

- **Feature conflicts:** The CLI will warn you about incompatible combinations
- **Missing dependencies:** The AI prompt will include all necessary dependencies
- **Configuration drift:** The CLI will detect and suggest fixes for inconsistencies

### 8. Advanced Usage

#### Command Line Flags:

```bash
# Force interactive mode
npm run init -- --interactive

# Preview changes without applying
npm run init -- --dry-run

# Update specific features only
npm run init -- --uiType=window --tailwind=false
```

#### Configuration File:

You can also edit `scaffold.json` directly and run the CLI to apply changes:

```bash
# Edit scaffold.json to add new features
# Then run CLI to apply changes
npm run init
```
